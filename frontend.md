# Frontend Developer Learning Path

## Basics (Fundamentals)

  - This has been recommended by numerous developers as a very good reference guide for moder javascript.

## React

- [React Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

  - This course probably is the best course online to start learning `React`. It not only covers basics of `React`, but also explores advanced topics in `React` as well. A very handly course worth watching twice.
  - This course is `React Hooks` oriented.
  - Me myself took this course and landed successfully as a `React` developer

## Vue
